# Java-Progamming-Assignment-1

Within this repository are 4 programs I created as part of my first Java programming assignment, 
during my year studying computer programming at Dublin City University.

-Program 1 (Q1): Continuously prompts the user to enter a sentence. When each sentence is read, the program displays the sentence in reverse.

-Program 2 (Q2): Asks the user to enter 3 inputs, namely a string and 2 numbers. The program prints out the substring of the string specified by the two numbers. 
                 For example if the user entered the string “hello” and the numbers 1 and 3, the program will print out “ell”: The program validates the user 
                 inputs to ensure the indices are correct. If they are not, it will continue to ask the user for inputs until they are valid so that the program always gives a successful result.

-Program 3 (Q3): This program requests and accepts 3 inputs from the user: A string, an integer and a double. The program passes the inputs to a method that converts the string to its equivalent numeric value
                 and adds this value to the sum of the remaining inputs. The program displays the result to the user.
                 To calculate the equivalent numeric value of the string: I've converteed the string to lowercase and then attributed a value to each character in the string. The letter a is worth 1, b worth 2, all the way up to the letter z being worth 26.
                 If it contains a digit, the value of that character is the value of the digit itself, 0 is worth 0, 1 worth 1, all the way up to 9 worth 9. Any other character in the string (for example: !$?*&^%) is worth 0.

-Program 4 (Q4): This program uses an array, a for loop and a method to conduct a survey of 3 questions to 4 people. Each question will have a yes or a no answer. 
                 The overall results of the survey should be presented to the user in percentage format.
                 
                 As part of this question there is also a <2 minute video discribing and showing my understanding of the code I have written, which was required for the assignment.
